# Federated-Clustering-and-Pattern-Recognition-for-Multi-Modal-Traffic-Data-in-Smart-Cities
Focuses on advancing unsupervised learning techniques like clustering to identify patterns, traffic flow segments, and vehicle behavior types from multi-modal sensor data streams (camera, radar, LiDAR, WSN).

Utilizes federated learning paradigms to perform decentralized clustering across geographically distributed edge nodes, preserving privacy and minimizing data transfer.

Enables discovery of novel traffic insights, such as identifying recurring congestion zones, atypical traffic patterns, and latent correlations between sensor modalities.

Supports data-driven urban planning and dynamic traffic management with autonomous model updates based on real-time sensor inputs.

This topic emphasizes exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition using modern distributed learning approaches integral to your ITS framework.
